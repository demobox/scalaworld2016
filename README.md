## Essential vs. Accidental Complexity in Scala & Dotty

#### Towards a Puzzler-free Future?

[Scala World 2016](https://scala.world/) presentation by Andrew Phillips and Dmitry Petrashko.

> (How) can we construct a programming language that is elegant without being elementary; expressive without becoming exasperating? Scala offers a wide range of features and ideas that can be as puzzling as they are powerful.

> We will take a look at these ideas and features and, through the lens of a "cluster analysis" of puzzlers, will try to identify parts of the language that are especially prone to head-scratching behaviour. We will examine which of the clusters are intrinsic and perhaps inevitable given Scala's design goals, and which are accidental and could possibly be avoided in future.

> We'll look forward to Dotty and the types of puzzling behaviour it will eliminate, and close with the story of a particularly pernicious "sleeping puzzler giant" that the Dotty team has slain.
